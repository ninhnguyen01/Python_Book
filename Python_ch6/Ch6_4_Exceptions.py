# Checkpoint

# 6.19 Briefly describe what an exception is. 
# A. An exception is an error that occurs while a program
# is running. In most cases, an exception causes a program
# to abruptly halt.

# 6.20 If an exception is raised and the program does not handle
# it with a try/except statement, what happens?
# A. The program halts.

# 6.21 What type of exception does a program raise when it tries
# to open a nonexistent file?
# A. IOError.

# 6.22 What type of exception does a program raise when it uses 
# the float function to convert a non-numeric string to a number?
# A. ValueError.
