# 6.16 What is a record? What is a field?
# A. A record is a complete set of data that describes one item,
# and a field is a single piece of data within a record.

# 6.17 Describe a way that you use a temporary file in a progam 
# that modifies a record in a sequential access file. 
# A. You copy all the original file's records to the temporary file,
# but when you get to the record that is to be modified, you do not
# write its old contents to the temporary file. Instead, you write
# its new, modified values to the temporary file. Then, you finish
# copying any remaining records from the original file to the 
# temporary file.

# 6.18 Describe the way that you use a temporary file in a program
# that deletes a record from a sequential file.
# A. You copy all the original file's records to the temporary file,
# except for the record that is to be deleted. The temporary file
# then takes the place of the original file. You delete the 
# original file and rename the temporary file, giving it the name
# that the original file had on the computer's disk.
