# Introduction to File Input and Output (Title)

#  Three Steps

# OPEN THE FILE
# PROCESS THE FILE (input or output)
# CLOSE THE FILE

# Types of Files (section)
# text (ASCII or Unicode) 
# Example -> '.txt'
# binary 
# Example -> '.dat'

# File Access Methods (section)
# sequential access file (beginning to end)
# direct access file (jump straight to file)
# [AKA random access file]

# Filenames and File Objects (section)
# file object - an object that is associated with a specific
# file and provides a way for the program to work with that 
# file.
# A variable references the file object.

# Opening a File (section)
# General Format 'open' Function:
# file_variable = open(filename, mode)

# Python file Modes
# 'r' (to read) [no change or writing]
# 'w' (to write) [file exist, erase, 
# or file no exist, create file]
# 'a' (to append) [file no exist, create file]

customer_file = open('customers.txt', 'r')
sales_file = open('sales.txt', 'w')

# Specifying a location of a file (section)
test_file = open('test.txt','w')

# Writing Data to a File (section)
# method - a function that belongs to an object
# and performs some operation using that object.
customer_file = open('customers.txt','w')

# General Format Write Method:
# file_variable.write(string)
customer_file.write('Charles Pace')

# alternate
name = 'Charles Pace' 
customer_file.write(name)

customer_file.close()

# This program writes three lines of data to a file.
def main():

# Reading Data from a File (section)
# 'read' method - returns file's contents as a string.

# Concatenating a Newline to a String (section)
# This program gets three names from the user and writes
# them to a file.

# Reading a String and Stripping the Newline from It (section)
# rstrip - removes or "strips" specific characters from the 
# end of a string.

# Writing and Reading Numeric Data (section)
# This program demonstrates how numbers must be converted
# to strings before they are written to a text file.

# 6.1 What is an output file?
# A. A file to which a program writes data. It is called an output
# file because the program sends output to it.
 
# 6.2 What is an input file?
# A. A file from which a program reads data. It is called an input
# file because the program receives input from it.

# 6.3 What three steps must be taken by a program when it uses a
# file? 
# A. (1) Open the file. (2) Process the file. (3) Close the file.

# 6.4 In general, what are the two types of files? What is the 
# difference between these two types of files?
# A. Text and binary. Test file is encoded using ASCII (set of 
# characters). Binary file is nontext and you cannot view with
# text editor.

# 6.5 What are the two types of file access? What is the difference
# between these two?
# A. Sequential and direct access. Sequential is data access from
# beginning of file to end. Direct is jumping to the data without
# reading any that comes before it. 

# 6.6 When writing a program that performs an operation on a file, what
# two file-associated names do you have to work with in your code?
# A. The file's name and the name of a variable that references a 
# file object.

# 6.7 If a file already exists, what happens to it if you try 
# to open it as an output file (using the 'w' mode)?
# A. The file's content are erased.

# 6.8 What is the purpose of opening a file?
# A. Opening a file creates a connection between the file and
# the program. It also creates an association between the file 
# and a file object.

# 6.9 What is the purpose of closing a file?
# A. Closing a file disconnects the program from the file.

# 6.10 What is a file's read position? Initially, where is the
# read position when an input file is opened?
# A. A file's read position marks the location of the next item
# that will be read from the file. When an input file is opened, 
# its read position is initially set to the first item in the file.

# 6.11 In what mode do you open a file if you want to write data to it, but
# you do not want to erase the file's existing contents? When you
# write data to such a file, to what part of the file is the data 
# written?
# A. You open the file in append mode. When you write data to a 
# file in append mode,the data is written to the end of the file's
# existing contents.
