# alarm_is_set(True or False)

# Object's Methods:
# set_time  
# set_alarm_time

# 10.1 What is an object?
# A. An object is a software entity that contains both data
# and procedures.

# 10.2 What is encapsulation?
# A. The combining of data and code into a single object.

# 10.3 Why is an object's internal data usually hidden
# from outside code? 
# A. When an object's internal data is hidden from outside code
# and access to that data is restricted to the object's methods,
# the data is protected from accidental corruption. In addition,
# the programming code outside the object does not need to know
# about the format or internal structure of the object's data.

# 10.4 What are public methods? What are private methods?
# A. Public methods can be accessed by entities outside the
# object. Private method cannot be accessed by entities 
# outside the object. They are designed to be accessed internally.
