# 5.1 What is a function?
# A: A group of statements that exist within a program for the 
# purpose of performing a specific task.

# 5.2 What is meant by the phrase "divide and conquer"?
# A: a large task is divided into several smaller tasks that are
# easily performed.

# 5.3 How do functions help you reuse code in a program?
# A: If a specific operation is performed in several places in a program,
# a function can be written once to perform that operation, and then
# be executed anytime it is needed. 

# 5.4 How can functions make the development of mutiple programs
# faster?
# A: Functions can be written for the commonly needed tasks that are needed
# by the different programs. Those functions can then 
# be incorporated into each program that needs it.

# 5.5 How can functions make it easier for programs to be developed 
# by teams of programmers?
# A: When a program is developed as a set of functions in which each
# performs an individual task, then different programmers can be 
# assigned the job of writing different functions.
